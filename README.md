# LudeumDare48
This is a repo for our LudumDare48 GameJam game.

The theme for this year was "Deeper and Deeper". With that in mind, we set out with the goal to create a simple game to completion. 

The game is a simple 2D scroller where you have to dodge asteroids and space debris to see how "Deep" you can get in space. It includes
powerups, fuel, rockets, and 2D physics mechanics. The game has been compiled down into a WebGL project, so feel free to try our game out in the browser
using the link below.
